# MechaCar

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.


This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study. You’ll submit the following:


* Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Answer

On this dataset, which is predicting miles per gallons, the result shows that the probability that each variables/coefficients helps to contributes a non-random amount of variance to the model, the length of the vehicle traveled and the clearance would not be enough to provide a statistical result of variance needed for the model.

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

* No, the slope is not considered to be zero because the p-value on this data is less than 0.05. The p-value of the linear model is one of the factors that would determine the slope of the linear model

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?



* Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils




* Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils



* Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
